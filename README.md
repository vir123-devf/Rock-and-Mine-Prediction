**Rock and Mine Prediction with Machine Learning**

This project implements a machine learning system in Python to distinguish between rocks and mines using sonar data. It leverages logistic regression, a powerful algorithm for binary classification tasks.

**Objective**

The primary goal is to build a model that can accurately predict whether a sonar signal corresponds to a rock or a mine based on its features. This can be crucial for underwater exploration and navigation purposes.

**Workflow**

1. **Data Acquisition:**
   - The project utilizes sonar data, typically provided in a CSV format.
   - Ensure you have access to a suitable dataset.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - This crucial step involves cleaning and preparing the data for model training.
   - Common preprocessing techniques might include:
     - Handling missing values (imputation or removal)
     - Feature scaling (normalization or standardization)
     - Outlier detection and treatment (if necessary)

3. **Data Splitting:**
   - The data is divided into two sets: training and testing.
   - The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set evaluates its performance on unseen data.
   - A common split ratio is 80% for training and 20% for testing, but you might experiment with different ratios.

4. **Model Training:**
   - Logistic regression is employed as the primary classification model.
   - The model learns to map the sonar features to a probability of being a rock or a mine.
   - Hyperparameter tuning (adjusting model parameters) might be necessary to optimize performance.

5. **Prediction:**
   - Once trained, the model can be used to predict the class (rock or mine) for new sonar data points.
   - The model outputs a probability, allowing you to determine the likelihood of a given signal being a rock or a mine.



**Requirements**

- Python (version specification)
- Essential libraries (e.g., NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn)

**Getting Started**

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/rock-mine-prediction.git`
2. Run the training script: `python train_model.py` (or similar)
